      <h2>Our Pastor</h2>
      <p>Pastor Anthony Trujillo served as Associate Pastor several years before being voted in as Head Pastor.  His call from God came with a burden for Catheys Valley.  After 15 years of faithful service, wearing many hats, he took his first pastorate.  He became our Pastor with a vision to eqiup people to live victoriously for God and to reach the lost of our community with the good news of Jesus Christ. </p>

      <h2>Our Church</h2>
      <p>Catheys Valley Baptist Church is an independent Baptist Church, with a loving country atmosphere and a solid conservative biblical foundation. We exist to share the Word of God with the world, and provide a safe and caring place where others can come to know the precious love of Jesus.</p>
      <p>Catheys Valley Baptist was founded by the First Baptist Church of Mariposa in 1992. A handful of people met for the first time in the home of one of our charter members. Our little country church was born of a desire to see Jesus Christ known and shared in our very own beautiful town of Catheys Valley. Ken Trujillo, was called to be our first pastor, and serves faithfully with his family still. Now established in a place of our own by the Lord's generous grace, It is our ongoing desire and purpose to impact our community and each and every person living in it with the love of Jesus.</p>
