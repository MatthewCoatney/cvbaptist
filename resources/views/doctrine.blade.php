    <h5>THE BIBLE</h5>
    <p>
    We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the verbally and plenarily inspired Word of God. 
  </p>
    <h5>THE TRUE GOD</h5>
    <p>
    We believe there is one, and only one, living and true God, an infinite, intelligent spirit, the maker and supreme ruler of heaven and earth.
  </p>
    <h5>THE GODHEAD</h5>
    <p> We believe in one triune God, eternally existing in three persons - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>

    <h5>THE DEITY OF JESUS CHRIST</h5>
  <p>  We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ; his virgin birth; and that he is the incarnation of the Father, very God of very God; for whom and by whom all things were created.
</p>
    <h5>THE FALL OF MAN</h5>
    <p>Man was created in a state of holiness, under the law of his maker; but by voluntary transgression he fell.
</p>
    <h5>THE PERSON AND WORK OF CHRIST</h5>
    <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man, without ceasing to be God.
</p>

        <h5>THE RESURRECTION</h5>
        <p>We believe in the bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, that he ascended bodily into Heaven and is now at the right hand of God.
</p>

  </div>
  <div class="columns large-6 medium-6">
    <h5>THE WAY OF SALVATION</h5>
         <p>	We believe that salvation is the gift of God brought to man by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
    </p>

    <h5>THE PERSON AND WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h5>
         	<p>We believe that the Holy Spirit is a person who convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.
</p>
    <h5>THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST</h5>
                <p>We believe in the imminent, literal, bodily return of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
               </p>

    <h5>ETERNAL SECURITY AND ASSURANCE OF BELIEVERS</h5> 
    <p>We believe that all the redeemed, once saved, are kept by God’s power and are thus secure in Christ forever.
</p>
    <h5>THE ETERNAL STATE</h5> 
    <p>We believe in the bodily resurrection of all men, the saved to eternal life, and the unsaved to judgment and everlasting punishment.
</p>
    <h5>THE CHURCH</h5>
    <p>We believe that the local church, which is the body and the espoused bride of Christ, is solely made up of born-again persons associated together by a covenant of faith and fellowship of the Gospel.
