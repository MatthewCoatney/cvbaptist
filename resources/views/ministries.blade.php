      <h2>Prayer</h2>
      <p>Prayer is a vital part of the Christian life, as well as a vital part of our church. Every Wednesday at 7:00PM we offer opportunity for prayer through our Bible Study and Prayer Meetings.</p>

      <h2>Youth</h2>
      <p>Catheys Valley Baptist has an active and vibrant Youth Ministry. We meet weekly on Sunday Nights at 6:00PM. With regular activities and special events there are opportunities for teens and young adults to serve and grow throughout the year.</p>


      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>Our church is committed to worship that honors God and engages people from every generation. We offer a variety of opportunities to praise God and be blessed with Christ honoring music. A choir, southern gospel quartet, and a unique style of worship
        reflective of our country church are just some of the highlights you will enjoy on your visit to CVBC.</p>

      <h2>Sunday School</h2>
      <p>Each Sunday Morning at 9:00AM we offer the unique opportunity to here the word taught through our Sunday School and Adult Bible Classes. It's a great opportunity for Christians of all ages to grasp the Word of God. You will be encouraged and enlightened
        by the practical teachings of difficult subjects. "Understanding Genesis" and "Doctrines 101: What every Christian needs to know about our core beliefs" are just some of the current lessons.</p>


      <h2>Community Outreach</h2>
      <p>Our community is precious to us. In addition to reaching Catheys Valley with the gospel of Christ each year through our spring door to door outreach we share throughout the year in regular soulwinning and visitation. We also invite the commuity
        to join us for various activities. Our fall Harvest and Music Festival is also an opportunity for the community to come and enjoy the spirit of CVBC.</p>
